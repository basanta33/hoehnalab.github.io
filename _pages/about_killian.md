    I am a computer scientist working with Bayesian phylogenetics and substitution models, and am interested in applying concepts and theory from CS in this domain.
    In my research, I will be exploring covarion models, mixture models, and Markov modulated continuous Markov chains (MMCMC), and their effects on phylogenetic tree construction.
    Some of my other research interests include type theory, functional programming, de novo sequencing, multiple sequence alignment, genome assembly, and machine learning.
