    My research uses statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, Big Data, and machine learning to understand morphological evolution and macroevolutionary patterns and processes.
    I am particularly interested in bringing a ‘next-generation’ approach (e.g., high-throughput automated data generation) to studying fossils and morphology in a phylogenetic context.
    I am also interested in the interplay between morphology and genetics, including methodological considerations during phylogenetic inference.
