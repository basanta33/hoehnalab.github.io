    I am a master's student in Evolutionary Biology.
    My research passion lies in computational and statistical phylogenetics, especially species tree inference from molecular data.
    I am currently working on evaluating the performance and properties of coalescent-based species tree inference methods using simulations.
    To offset my screen time, I enjoy exploring nature through hiking and botanizing.
