    Iâ€™m a biologist working on statistical methods for inferring the evolutionary history of closely related populations.
    These methods are based on coalescent theory and a mutation process.
    I am using simulated as well as empirical data to test and to validate these methods, hoping to provide an accurate, powerful and computationally feasible approach.
