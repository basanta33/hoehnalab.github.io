    I am an evolutionary biologist with a backgournd in genomics and phylogenetics, specializing in evolution models of gene families and gene expression.
    My current project is to investigate the sexual dimorphism in fireflies (Family: Lampyridae) within a phylogenetic framework, and I am developing methods to study gene expression of multiple species and individuals across a phylogeny.
    Besides, I am also interested in speciation and hybridization events, having worked on avian hybridization during my Master thesis.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and mountain hiking.
