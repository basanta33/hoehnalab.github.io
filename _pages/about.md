<h4>Welcome to the lab of Sebastian Höhna at <a href='https://www.lmu.de'>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München</a>.</h4>
<br>
<br>
Our primary aim is to develop new statistical models and computational methods to answer research questions in phylogenetics, which include:

<p>(1) Estimating phylogenetic relationships;</p>
<p>(2) Estimating divergence times and rates of molecular evolution;</p>
<p>(3) Inferring rates and mode of lineage diversification (speciation and extinction);</p>
<p>(4) Analyzing causes of conflicting gene trees;.</p>
