    I am a computational biologist working mostly in morphological character evolution models.
    My research involves estimating phylogenetic trees in a more robust manner using more adequate models of evolution.
    In the past, I have worked on species delimitation studies on Mexican livebearer fishes and Eastern Pine snakes.
    My work also involved assessing the impact of morphological state space on phylogenetic inferences and trying to allow for different stationary frequencies in morphological character evolution.
    I will be exploring more on the use of various models for morphological character evolution.
