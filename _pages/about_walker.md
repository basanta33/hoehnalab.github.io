    I am a Master's student in the Paleobiology and Geobiology program.
    My undergraduate research at Washington University in St. Louis focused on developing an empirical hominin phylogeny and investigating the problems that entailed.
    I am currently working to understand lineage diversification models and developing models to infer phylogeny from morphological data.
    Outside of the lab, I enjoy traveling, juggling, and exploring the many cultural opportunities Munich has to offer!
