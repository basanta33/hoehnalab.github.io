    I am a computational evolutionary biologist interested in macroevolution and trait evolution.
    I am currently working with Sebastian, Bj√∏rn and John in developing a state-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for continuous character evolution in RevBayes.
    During my undergrad, I studied the phylogenetics of Hawaiian Doryopteris (Pteridaceae) using target enrichment probe set GoFlag.
    Besides research, I also enjoy curating herbarium specimens, observing linguistics behaviors (sound production and perception), watching baseball games, and playing classic, abstract games (currently minesweeper).
