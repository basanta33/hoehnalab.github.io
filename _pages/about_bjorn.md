    I am an evolutionary biologist who is interested in estimating speciation- and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees.
    In my research, I have been investigating the challenge associated with non-identifiability in the time-variable reconstructed birth-death model, as presented by Louca & Pennell (2020) in Nature.
    Specifically, we have found that rapidly changing speciation and extinction rates can be robustly inferred in spite of non-identifiability.
    Additionally, I am working on developing a fast algorithm for a lineage-specific birth-death model with finite categories, which is used to infer shifts in rates along the phylogeny.
    Previously, this model has relied on Monte Carlo methods for estimating the rate and number of shifts along each branch.
    With our new approach, we do not need to use the Monte Carlo approach.
    Consequently, our method is much faster, there is no stochasticity in the estimation procedure, and we can readily fit the lineage-specific birth-death model to large trees with tens of thousands of taxa.
    My other interests include data mining using natural language processing, brain size evolution and phylogenetic comparative models of adaptation.
    My favorite organisms are bryozoans and ruminants!
