    Iâ€™m a vertebrate paleontologist working on macroevolution of crocodylomorphs (group that also includes living
    crocodilians).
    My research is dedicated to a critical reassessment of paleontological and neontological data to be subsequently
    incorporated into analyses that combine morphological, molecular and stratigraphic (fossil age) data simultaneously
    (total-evidence tip dating).
    The focus of my studies is to provide more rigorous time-scaled phylogenies in order to better understanding
    macroevolutionary processes underlying crocodylomorph evolutionary history.
