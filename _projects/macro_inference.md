      Our ultimate goal is to infer diversification rates through time and among lineages and identify correlations to genetic, phenotypic and/or environmental factors that impact diversification rate.
      For example, we developed a statistical method to identify correlations between rates of diversification and environmental variables, such as changes in atmospheric CO2.
      In our future work, we want to incorporate fossil occurrence information in our models of lineage diversification.
