      <p>
      The following biological scenarios can cause incongruent gene trees: (a) simple population genetic processes (i.e., the coalescent), (b) migration and thus gene-flow between species/populations , and (c) gene-duplication and gene-loss.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are working on more realistic models that incorporate different causes of gene-tree incongruence such as the multispecies coalescent with migration model.
      This work also entails new algorithm development and theory design for more efficient computation of species trees from thousands of gene trees.
