title: MacDrive
description: MacDrive is a multidisciplinary project combining molecular and morphological data of extant and fossil taxa in order to investigate diversification rates over geological time scales and potential correlation of speciation and extinction events with major global events, such as climate change or change in vegetation. Taxonomic focus is on Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Crocodyliformes and Squaliformes.

      <h3>
      We would like to find out whether speciation or extinction events in the geological past were linked with global events such as climate change.
      For this we collect morphological and genetic data of living and extinct organisms.
      Our focus is on even-toed ungulates, carnivores, croocdiles, and sharks.

# Core
One of the major topics/questions/challenges in evolutionary biology is to identify/investigate causes and processes that have shaped biodiversity over space and time.
MacDrive pursues a holistic approach using combined phylogenies of extinct and extant taxa to investigate different drivers or correlates of diversification rates.
It unites multiple disciplines such as statistics, computer science, palaeobiology and evolutionary biology.
Specifically, we test if diversification patterns of Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Crocodyliformes and Squaliformes vary over time.
Speciation or extinction events will be tested for potential correlation with environmental variables, such as global temperatures, CO2 levels and sea-levels and/or whether they have lineage-specific rate shifts that are correlated with species-specific factors such as habitat, diet, body size and biome.
An extraordinary and well-studied fossil record is required in order to estimate speciation rates (of species) compared to origination rates (of genera or families).
The aims of the MacDrive project are development of new statistical models, implementation of these models in open-source software with new efficient algorithms, generation of new morphological datasets and phylogenies, and performance of large-scale statistical analyses investigating macroevolutionary diversification.


# Questions
- Why are some groups of organisms much more diverse compared to others?
- Which processes and factors drive changes in the rate of diversification (speciation and extinction) at a global macroevolutionary level?
- How have diversification rates changed over time and among lineages for major groups such as Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Crocodyliformes and Squaliformes?
- Are diversification rates correlated with environmental factors that affect all lineages equally and/or species-specific factors affecting only few lineages?
- Are species-specific factors correlated with survival probabilities of mass extinction events?

# Groups
Artiodactyla and Carnivora have been selected to study diversification rates at an intermediate timescale.
Both taxonomic groups span a wide range of habitats, body sizes and dietary preferences, which are ideal predictors to test for state-dependent diversification.
These two datasets are specious enough to allow for comparisons of diversification rates estimated from extant only vs combined phylogenies.
Crocodyliformes and Squaliformes have been selected for their extraordinary and well-studied taxon-rich fossil record with a focus on longterm macroevolutionary questions, particularly, mass-extinction events.
Both groups are very old in geological terms and show a continuing drastic decrease in species numbers until today.
These two data sets will be tested for potential correlation of any species-specific factors (e.g., body size or ecosystem) with survival probabilities of mass-extinction events.
