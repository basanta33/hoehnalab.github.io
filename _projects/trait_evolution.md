      Joint inference of continuous trait adaptation and selective regime history using the state-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.
      Trait evolution studies the evolution of homologous characters across phylogeny.
      These characters are at above-sequence level, including but not limited to gene expression, physiological, and morphological data.
      Many phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been developed to study trait evolution, yet to what extent these models reflect realistic evolutionary processes is still under debate.
      Here, we have developed the state-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, a Bayesian approach to jointly infer the evolution of a continuous trait and the discrete selective regimes.
